# mhdned.github.io

This is my GitHub Pages site — a cozy little corner of the internet where I showcase my favorite projects and experiments.

It's simple, static, and written by hand in HTML — no fancy frameworks, no over-engineered build systems. Just good ol' HTML and CSS.

## Overview

I created this site to share what I'm working on, from satellite data tools to AI-powered image search engines. It's a lightweight landing page that links to my public work and gives people a quick intro to who I am as a developer.

If you're reading this and wondering "Why not use a fancy template?" — well, I like to keep things minimal, and sometimes, raw HTML feels more personal.

## Projects Featured

This site highlights some of my active and archived repositories, including:

- [FEZrs](https://github.com/FEZtool-team/FEZrs) – Remote sensing toolkit
- [Imagiuo](https://github.com/mhdned/Imagiuo) – AI-based image search
- [Petiuo](https://github.com/mhdned/Petiuo) – Pet adoption sample app
- [SmileDetection](https://github.com/mhdned/SmileDetection) – Computer vision smile detector

## Deployment

This site is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The setup is dead simple:

1. The repo name **must** be exactly `mhdned.github.io`
2. Just push an `index.html` to the root of the repo
3. GitHub Pages does the rest

If you're curious, check out the source — it's all in the `main` branch.
